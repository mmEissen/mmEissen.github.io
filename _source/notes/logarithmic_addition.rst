Run Time Complexity of Addition
===============================

When we analyse run time complexity we often assume that addition has a constant run time complexity. For most intents and purposes this is true. However it is actually possible to empirically show that adding two integers has a logarithmic run time complexity.

This measurement is done with python 3.6. As you can see, the measurements taken can be approximated with a linear trendline. The horizontal axis denotes the exponent of the number added, therefore the trend line is a logarithmic function of the number. This is evidence for the logarithmic run time complexity of addition in python.

The measurements were produced with the following code snippet:

.. code-block::
    python

    >>> import timeit
    >>> exponents_and_numbers = [(e, 2 ** e) for e in range(1000000, 100000001,1000000)]
    >>> for e, a in exponents_and_numbers:
    ...     time = timeit.timeit("a + 1", number=100, globals=globals())
    ...     print(f"{e},{time}")
    ...

    2000000,0.008900251996237785
    3000000,0.01304833900212543
    4000000,0.01772469299612567
    5000000,0.02196525000181282
       ... etc. (full output below)

This is of course only a curiosity. In most cases we aren't concerned about the time complexity of addition, because there is an upper bound on the summands given by the fixed length binary representation in many languages.
